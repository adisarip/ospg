While installing QEMU through homebrew ... following message at last:
=====================================================================

ncurses is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have ncurses first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ncurses/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ncurses/include"

For pkg-config to find ncurses you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib/pkgconfig"
