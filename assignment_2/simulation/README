## Test / Simulation workspace for the Torrent File Sharing System ##

Directory Structure:
config
tracker_1
tracker_2
node_1
node_2
node_3
...

=> Create the required number of node_x directories based on the number of P2P nodes you are planning to run.
=> Every Client Node has to be run inside its corresponding node_x directory.
=> By default the simulation directory will have "3" node_x (with x = 1,2,3) directories.
=> "config" directory is to store and common configuration files used in the execution/running of the application. (e.g. seeder_list)
=> The Test Data for transfers in placed under assignment_2/data/ directory.
=> The torrent file created by the client will be saved in its respective node_x directory.
=> For download requests the client (who is about to request for a download), needs to copy the torrent file in his node_x directory.
=> It will be good to select the destination directory for downloads under the node_x directory, however its not mandatory.
